<h3>Conflict Urbanism:</h3>
<h5>Global Grids : Populations at Risk (Phase I) </h5>

Project Description:
Global Grids: Populations at Risk makes visible civilian Nuclear Power Plants in relation to territories of risk. 296 Nuclear Plants have been extracted from high-resolution satellite imagery from Digital Globe, through Mapbox, in Nov 2015, and set against a dataset named the Gridded Population of the World.

This composite allows us to estimate and display population vulnerable to nuclear accidents based on a 30km radius of each plant. Inadvertently the images captured from Mapbox have embedded within them another politics, which displays automatically, of transparency. Notice the blurring, blocking, and even manipulating of the satellite imagery exposed in the grid.

Note:
Global Grids: Populations at Risk is the first in a series of projects under the title, 'Conflict Urbanism' in preparation by Center for Spatial Research, Columbia University. Phase II of the project with an interactive map of Nuclear Sites and Populations at Risk, will be launched Jan 2016.

The project is currectly on display at the Shenzen Bi-City Biennale of Urbanism / Architecture
